Im a Programmer, writing, debugging, testing the SOA software suite for Fiorano Software currently. We are a middleware company based in California, US. 

I work for Adapters Team which has one of the finest programmers I have seen in my life, it develops many components such as Database Integration, Webservices, XML parsing/manipulation, Encryption, JMS adapters, amongst a host of others. 

Being in a Middleware firm exposes me to infinite possibilities, learning about how to connect front-end interfaces with backend gives me an opportunity to learn both of them. Working at Fiorano Software has been a great learning experience.

In my free time I like to do competitive coding on codechef, hackerrank. Its the most engaging thing that I can possibly imagine. Apart from that I support open source softwares such as RestFiddle, Clementine music player.
