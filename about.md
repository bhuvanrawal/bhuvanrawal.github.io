Im an alumunus of BITS-Pilani Goa campus, class of 2013. I am a keen traveller and have visited length and breadth of India.
I also like to trek on holidays, I believe that best places in the world are inaccesible by roads. Although my current job keeps me busy most of the time, in my free time I can be found fiddling tunes on my guitar.

Im currently working as a Software Engineer with Fiorano Software. Im a fan of Elon Musk. Currently I write, debug, test the SOA software suite of Fiorano Software. We are a middleware company based in California, US.

I work for Adapters Team which has one of the finest programmers I have seen in my life, it develops many components such as Database Integration, Webservices, XML parsing/manipulation, Encryption, JMS adapters, amongst a host of others.

Being in a Middleware firm exposes me to infinite possibilities Learning about how to connect front-end interfaces with backend gives me an opportunity to learn both of them. Working at Fiorano Software has been a great learning experience.

In my free time I like to do competitive coding on codechef, hackerrank. Its the most engaging thing that I can possibly imagine. Apart from that I support open source softwares such as RestFiddle, Clementine music player.
