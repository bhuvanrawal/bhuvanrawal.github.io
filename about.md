Im an alumunus of BITS-Pilani Goa campus, class of 2013. I am a keen traveller and have visited length and breadth of India. I also like to trek on holidays, I believe that best places in the world are inaccesible by roads. Although my current job keeps me busy most of the time, in my free time I can be found fiddling tunes on my guitar.
